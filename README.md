## About The Project

This application powers The Code Log website, which provides code notes and snippets for software development concepts.

There were several reasons for working on this project, including the chance to:

- work with WordPress
- create a development pipeline via Gulp
- implement styles using SASS
- use jQuery

## Getting Started

The following information will provide you with the details necessary to get the application up and running locally.

### **Prerequisites**

Since this application pertains to the `wp-content` folder and tooling to build the custom `thecodelog` theme, you'll first need to download [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and then copy over all files and folders that do not conflict with the code for this project.

Next you'll want to ensure that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version `16.13.2` is installed on your operating system of choice. It is recommended that a Node Version Manager be used, such as [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). When installing `NodeJS` this way, the correctly associated `npm` version should automatically be installed.

```sh
nvm install node@16.13.2
```

You'll also need server software to run `Apache` (web server) and `MySQL` (DB server), the default setup for WordPress sites. [MAMP (mac)](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/mac/) or [MAMP (windows)](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/windows/) can provide a local environment to handle both these needs.

It's also recommended to download a `MySQL` GUI, such as [SequelPro](https://sequelpro.com/) or [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) to more easily interface with the database. Once installed, and DB server is running, you can create a new local connection similar to the below:

```sh
host: 127.0.0.1
root: root
password: root
```

Once a connection is made, you can create your local database according to your [wp-config](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/wp-config-php/).

### **Installation**

Once `NodeJS` and `npm` are installed you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DeanGilewicz/myblog.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```

## Usage

To avoid redirects while working locally you need to comment out the following in `.htaccess`:

```sh
# RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80
# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.thecodelog.com/$1 [R=301,L]

# RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^thecodelog.com [nocase]
# RewriteRule ^(.*) https://www.thecodelog.com/$1 [last,redirect=301]
```

Start the Apache and DB servers and then run `gulp` to watch and rebuild both `js` and `css` files. You can then visit [http://thecodelog.localhost/](http://thecodelog.localhost/) (or the url defined in your `wp-config` file) to view the application.

<br />

## Deployment

This application can be hosted on any service that supports WordPress. At its most basic, you'll need a running `MySQL` DB and a configured [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) web server (or [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/)) to handle requests.
